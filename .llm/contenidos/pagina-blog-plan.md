* Create an API route (e.g., src/app/api/blog/route.ts) to fetch actual data from your Supabase blog_posts table.
* Replace the mock data fetching in useEffect with a call to this API route.
* Create the dynamic route page src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx to display individual blog posts.
* Refine the UI/UX of the blog components (BlogPostCard, BlogPostsLayout, BlogSidebar).
* Potentially add more sophisticated filtering (by tags, categories derived from issues, etc.).
* Consider Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for better performance and SEO by fetching data outside the "use client" component.
